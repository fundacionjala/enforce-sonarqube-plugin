TestClassCheckAnnotationMessage = The "@isTest" annotation should be used only for classes, remove it from the declaration of "{0}".
TestClassCheckNameMessage = The name of the class "{0}" suggests this is a test class, either add an "@isTest" annotation or change the name of the class.
TestMethodsCheckMessage = The method "{0}" is marked as a testMethod but it is not in a test class, move it to a proper class or add the "@isTest" annotation to the class "{1}".
