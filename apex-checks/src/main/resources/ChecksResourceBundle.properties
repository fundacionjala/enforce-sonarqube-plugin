#Old checks
ClassNameCheckMessage = Rename class "{0}" to match the regular expression {1}.
DeprecatedMethodCheckMessage = The "%s" method is deprecated, suggest deleting the contents of the method.
DmlInConsCheckMessage = The DML statement "%s", can not be inside a constructor.
DmlInForCheckMessage = The DML statement "%s", can not be inside a for loop.
DmlInWhileCheckMessage = The DML statement "%s", can not be inside a while loop.
MethodNameCheckMessage = Rename method "{0}" to match the regular expression {1}.
TestMethodCheckMessage = The "%s" method corresponds to a test class.

#Check messages
AsyncMethodsCheckMessage = Method "{0}" is Async, should not be called within a loop.
IdsInVariablesCheckMessage = Variable "%s" contains hard-coded id value.
HardcodingIdsInMethodsCheck = Statement contains hard-coded value %s.
TestClassCheckAnnotationMessage = The "@isTest" annotation should be used only for classes, remove it from the declaration of "{0}".
TestClassCheckNameMessage = The name of the class "{0}" suggests this is a test class, either add an "@isTest" annotation or change the name of the class.
TestMethodsCheckMessage = The method "{0}" is marked as a testMethod but it is not in a test class, move it to a proper class or add the "@isTest" annotation to the class "{1}".
AssertionError = Test method "%s" should have at least one assertion.
TestMethodKeywordError = Test method "%s" must have "testMethod" keyword.
SeeAllDataCheckMessage = Class "{0}" is using the annotation "@isTest" with the "(seeAllData = true)" parameter, this is not recommendable; you can leave the annotation, but you should remove the parameter.
TestMethodParametersError = Test method in line {0} has parameters, test methods should not have parameters.
LiteralBooleanAssertCheckMessage = The method "{0}" is passing an assertion a literal boolean value, this is a bad practice.
AssertionMessageCheckMessage = Test method "{0}" is calling an assertion, it is recommendable to pass a message in case of test failure.
AssertBooleanVariableMessage = Method {0} has a wrong System.assert parameter, it should be a boolean one.
StartAndStopCheckMessage = The test method "{0}" is calling "Test.testStart" and/or "Test.testStop" more than once.
SoqlLimitCheckMessage = Define the LIMIT for this SOQL statement.
EmptyCatchCheckMessage = Catch block should not be empty.

RecoveryCheckMessage = Parsing error found, the block was skipped during the analysis.
ParameterCountCheckMessage = The maximum number of parameters in method/constructor is: {0}.
ClassLengthCheckMessage = The maximum number of statements in class is: {0}.
MethodLengthCheckMessage = The maximum number of statements in method is: {0}.
SoqlFileInLoopCheckMessage = SOQL statements should not be in loops.
DeeplyNestedIfStmtsCheckMessage = Avoid creating deeply nested if-then statements since they are harder to read and error-prone to maintain, limit to {0}.
MethodNameAsClassNameCheck = Non-constructor methods should not have the same name as the enclosing class.
VariableCountCheck = Classes that have too many fields/variables can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer,possibly through grouping related fields/variables in new objects. The maximum number of fields/variables in class is: {0}.
