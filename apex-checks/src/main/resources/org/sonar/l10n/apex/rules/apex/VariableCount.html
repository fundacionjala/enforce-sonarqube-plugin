  <p>
    Classes that have too many fields/variables can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer,possibly through grouping related fields/variables in new objects.

  <pre>
    public class Person {
        // too many separate fields
        int birthYear;
        int birthMonth;
        int birthDate;
        float height;
        float weight;
    }
    
    public class Person {
        // this is more manageable
        Date birthDate;
        BodyMeasurements measurements;
    }
